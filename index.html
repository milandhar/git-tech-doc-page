          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate — generally no information is needed from another computer on your network. If you’re used to a CVCS where most operations have that network latency overhead, this aspect of Git will make you think that the gods of speed have blessed Git with unworldly powers. Because you have the entire history of the project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.
        </p>
        <p>Everything in Git is checksummed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You can’t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.
        </p>
        <p>When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database. It is hard to get the system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you haven’t committed yet, but after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is very difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository.
        </p>
        <p>Pay attention now — here is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of your learning process to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged:
          <ul>
            <li>Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.</li>
            <li>Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.</li>
            <li>Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>You modify files in your working tree.</li>
            <li>You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.</li>
            <li>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
          If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it’s considered committed. If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.
